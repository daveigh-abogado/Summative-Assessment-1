The Monty Hall problem starts with 3 doors. Behind 1 of these doors is a car, and the other 2 are goats. You pick 1 door of your choice, and then "Monty" picks one of the unopened doors which is guaranteed to be a goat. This means that between your door and the other door, one is the car and the other is the goat. The question is, do you change your door of choice to the other door or stick to your initial choice?
<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, while it may seem like a 50/50 probability, it was found that changing your door to the other one has a 2/3 probability of winning. Why is this the case?
<br>
<br>
(insight here)
<br>
<br>
Initially, let's assume that there is no bias or influence that's helping us determine which door is likely to be the car or a goat at the start. This means that each door equally has a 1/3 probability of being picked. If our first choice is a goat, then switching would result in the car. On the other hand, if your first choice is the car, then switching would surely result in a goat. While the odds may seem equal, take note that we have 2 options for the goat behind the door. This means that, given we switch doors at the end, we now have 2 doors that will lead to victory, or essentially a 2/3 chance of winning like mentioned a while ago.
